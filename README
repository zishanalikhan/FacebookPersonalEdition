What it will do?
Use your facebook login to fetch your facebook friends list and wall posts. Website will not store any facebook password or username. 

How to use? (For new users, tomcat implementation)
If you are using Tomcat under directory webapps create a subdirectory called 'myfacebookapp' (you can choose any name but please update your web.xml)
create following directories under it - images, META-INF, WEB-INF and place index.html and result.jsp here. Then create two directories under WEB-INF 
classes, lib and copy paste the web.xml under web-inf. create the proper directory sturcture under classes or compile with javac from prompt using -d swithch
copy all libraties to lib folder. copy the image connectfacebook2.jpg to images folder.
Please do not forget to include your APIKEY, SECRETKEY and REDIRECTURI to 'accessTokenRedirectServlet' and 'codeRedirectServlet'. Website will not work if 
you will not supply the proper keys. If you dont know where to get these keys I suggest please go to facebook developers page and read the docs.
Enjoy!!

Technicals:
I used Facebook OPENGRAPH API and RestFB an open source Java API as Facebook do not provide any support for java. 
It is based on pure JSP/Servlets implementation. please note it is best viewed in google chrome and not tested in other browsers.
RestFB do not provide any code for Authentication with facebook OAuth2.0 so I used smartam.leeloo client you can get the leeloo from 
https://bitbucket.org/smartproject/oauth-2.0/wiki/Home.
